- Java streams represents to pipeline from which data can flow and streams can perform the rich operation on the data such as transforming,intermediate and terminal etc.
- Streams are Lazy in nature because of terminal operation will triggers the pipeline,operations won't be perform in advance for us according to terminal operation pipeline will be trigger.

- Intermediate operations
    1. Filter   -> act as a gate
    2. Map      -> act as a transformer (Stream will process element in swimline )
    3. Flatmap  -> flatten the nested structure (listOfLists)
    4. pick     -> Perform various operations on stream without modifying the data typically use to print the stream.(use case : to see all the element before or after any intermediate operation)
    5. distinct -> filter out duplicates
    6. Sorted   -> sort in ascending order by default uses comparator for custom sort
    7. Skip     -> skips n number of element from the starting of stream
    8. Limit    -> works opposite of skip, controls n number of element from the starting of stream

- Terminal operations
    1. Collect
       GroupingBy       -> group the element based on condition and returns map
       PartitioningBy   -> segregates data and returns boolean and the result
    2. Min              -> returns minimum from the stream if present else returns optional
    3. Max              -> returns maximum from the stream if present else returns optional
    4. FindFirst        -> pick the first element from stream if present
    5. AnyMatch         -> returns boolean if match found
    6. Count            -> returns count of present element
    7. Sum              -> applied on int stream only to perform the sum
    8. Reduce           -> Reduce collection into one element, takes 2 args 1st arg is identity, position from where operation starts 2nd is the operation that performed with the subsequent element.

 Parallel Stream -> Performs operation on the stream in the parallel mostly used for computational heavy operation
                    Complex operation better execution and optimizes time.
